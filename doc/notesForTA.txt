    only with determinate websites as it doesn't support connect requests. In my 
    linux virtual machine I managed to get it working with images but for some 
    reason it wasn't working in the lab machines.

    The proxy works with example.com after taking off the s in https but it 
    doesn't load the images because they are requested as a connect.
