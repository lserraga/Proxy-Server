
                Specification of the application-layer protocol:

        The proxy is initialazied with a port number and a txt with the banned websites.
        It sets up a listening TCP socket and enters an infinite loop waiting for connections
        from the browser. As soon as a a browser is connected it forks a new process for
        it.


        It analizes the request from the browser and it checks if its correct and not for
        a banned website. Then it uses the function getaddressinfo() to get the ip 
        address of the remote server host. If it is succesful it connects to it. The proxy
        analizes the response and depending if there is a content-;ength header or not 
        it will retransmitt the response in 2 differetn ways.


        If there isn't it just sends everything to the browser as it comes however, if 
        there is one, it will check that all the bytes are sent. After fully responding
        to the request it closes the connection and frees the sockets.
